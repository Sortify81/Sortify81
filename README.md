## üìñ Overview

Indonesia is facing growing environmental challenges, especially in the area of waste management. One key issue is the lack of proper waste sorting practices, which significantly hinders recycling efforts and contributes to environmental pollution.

To address this problem, we developed an **interactive web-based platform** that helps users identify and classify waste types from uploaded images. This platform leverages **YOLOv8**, a state-of-the-art machine learning model for object detection, to accurately recognize and categorize **six different types of waste**. The solution integrates a **Flask-based backend API** and a **user-friendly frontend interface**, offering a seamless and educational experience.

## üéØ Purpose

Despite the increasing awareness of environmental issues, many people still find it difficult to correctly sort their waste due to limited knowledge or accessibility. Our platform was designed to simplify this process and promote sustainable habits through the help of technology.

By making waste classification more accessible and engaging, we aim to:

- Raise public awareness about proper waste management  
- Empower individuals to take part in recycling practices  
- Promote the adoption of AI-driven solutions for sustainability  

This project covers the **entire development cycle**, from **data collection, model training, full-stack development, to deployment**, making it a comprehensive solution to a pressing real-world problem.
